# Pubs Database — MySQL Version  
*(Microsoft SQL Server “Pubs” Sample Database Port)*

A fully compatible **MySQL 8.0+ port** of the classic **Microsoft SQL Server “Pubs” sample database**.  
This repository rebuilds the full schema, data, views, stored procedures, and triggers using MySQL syntax.

---

## Project Overview

The **Pubs** database was originally created by **Microsoft** as a teaching sample for SQL Server.  
It demonstrates essential relational database concepts such as:

- Table creation and referential constraints  
- Primary & foreign keys  
- Views, indexes, and stored procedures  
- Triggers and transaction control  

This repository adapts it for **MySQL 8.0**, maintaining the same logic and original data while ensuring syntax compatibility.
